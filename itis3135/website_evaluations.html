            <h3><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></h3>
            <h4>Stack Overflow is a question and answer platform used by millions of
                people who code. Created by Jeff Atwood and Joeal Spolsky in 2008,
                Stack Overflow contains questions and answers covering a wide range
                of different programming languages and topics. The design of the user
                interface is organized and laid out in a clean and understandable manner
                for the user.
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast: From the white background and the black background
                    to the orange and blue boxes in the middle of the page, Stack
                    Overflow follows the principle of contrast. The various font sizes used to get the
                    users attention to flow naturally down the website allows the website
                    to be visually pleasing and engaging.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                    Repetition: Stack Overflow follows the principle of repetition to 
                    draw the users attention to different objects on the website. Stack Overflow uses the
                    repetition of different colored blocks with information and a hyperlink
                    to get establish a consistent design pattern.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                    Alignment: Stack Overflow follows the principle of alignment to give the
                    website an organize feel. The side by side of the blocks of colored
                    information helps them pop out and seperate them from the rest of the
                    information on the website. The different rows of statistics about the
                    website help keep the similar information grouped together.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                Proximity: Stack Overflow follows the principle of proximity to allow
                the website have a decluttered look and feel for the user. The different rows of similar
                information helps emphasize and organize the information for the user.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
            <h4>Arngren is a Norwegian website that is used to sell an assorment of
                devices and gadgets. Arngren presents a large collection of items, from 
                electronics to ATVs to bicycles. Despite the simple job of this website,
                the design of the user interface is disorganize and in shambles.
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast: Arngren does not follow the principle of contrast causing
                    the page to not have natural flow. Arngren uses a white background for
                    the whole website with random blue, green, and yellow backgrounds thrown in,
                    giving the website an inconsistent look.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                Repetition: Arngren does not follow the principle of repetition giving the page
                an inconsistent and confusing look for the user. Arngrens use of differently
                sized advertisements and differently colored names numbers give the page
                and uncoordinated and erratic design.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                Alignment: Arngren does not follow the principle of alignment giving the
                website a cluttered feel. The randomly placed advertisements and the inconsistent
                shape and size of the black borders around the advertisements gives the
                advertisements an out of place and unorganized feel.
                </li>
            <br><li>
                Proximity: Arngren does not follow the principle of proximity preventing
                the website from having a decluttered look and feel for the user. Similar
                advertisements are randomly placed and spread out from each other causing
                the website to be disorganized, making the user have to search for similar
                advertisements.
