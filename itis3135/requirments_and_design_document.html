        <h4>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I will implement a comments section where the user will fill out a form with two text boxes, one for the users name and one for whatever comments the user has. This will be implemented on the home page because it allows the user go back to the start page and leave a comment, rather than have the user go searching through the navigation bar for the page that contains the comments section.</li>
            <li>I will implement a photo gallery. This photo gallery will contain photos of all of the recipes mentioned on the website. This will be implemented on the home page because it entices the user to go and look for the recipe of the visually appealing dish.</li>
        </ul>
